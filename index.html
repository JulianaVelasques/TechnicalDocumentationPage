            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages
            — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
            displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
            etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard
            web technologies, that includes HTML and CSS.
          </p>

            HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example
            defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting
            background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
          </li>
          <li>
            JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control
            multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what
            you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

            The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features that allow you to do
            things like:
          </p>
          <li>Store useful values inside variables.</li>
          <li>Operations on piece of text (known as "strings" in programming).</li>
          <li>Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.</li>
          <li>And much more!</li>
          <p>
            What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top of the client-side JavaScript language.
            So-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide you with extra superpowers to use in your
            JavaScript code.
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would
            otherwise be hard or impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that ready-made
            furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to
            make a bookshelf than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct wood, cut all the
            panels to the right size and shape, find the correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a
            bookshelf.

            You have to ways To get started with writing JavaScript. First, if you want to write your JS code inside
            your HTML page, you will need to add the <code>&lt; script &gt;</code> element:
            <!--Esse símbolos representam < e >-->
          </p>
          <code> &lt;script&gt; // JavaScript goes here &lt;/script&gt; </code>
          <p>Now you can add some JavaScript inside your <code>&lt;script&gt;:</code></p>

          <code>
            document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() { function createParagraph() { let para =
            document.createElement('p'); para.textContent = 'You clicked the button!'; document.body.appendChild(para);
            } const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button'); for(let i = 0; i &lt; buttons.length ; i++) {
            buttons[i].addEventListener('click', createParagraph); } });
          </code>
          <p>Now you should see that when you click the button, a new paragraph is generated and placed below.</p>
          <p>
            However, if you want to write your JavaScript code in external file, you will nee to create a new file in
            the same directory as your sample HTML file and call it <code>script.js</code>, then replace your current
            <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element with the following:
          </p>
          <code>&lt;script src="script.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code>
          <p>Now you can write your JavaScriptcode within it page.</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
            identifiers, conform to certain rules
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters
            can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
            "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode
            escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
            _name.

        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <article>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword <code>var</code>, as in:</p>
          <code> var x = 42 </code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
          <p>By simply assigning it value, as in:</p>
          <code> x = 42 </code>
          <p>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.
          </p>
          <p>With the keyword <code>let</code>, as in:</p>
          <code>let y = 13</code>
          <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

        <header>If...else statement</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
            execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          </p>
          <code> if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } </code>
          <p>
            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
            follows:
          </p>
          <code>
            if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; } else if (condition_n) {
            statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="While_statement">
        <header>While statement</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
            statement looks as follows:
          </p>
          <code> while (condition) statement </code>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <p>The following while loop iterate as lonng as n is less than three:</p>
          <code> var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; } </code>
          <p>
            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
            following values:
          </p>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
